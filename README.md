## My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio where I display my achievements and provide information about myself. 
The aim of my portfolio is to capture the attention of people to make potential business partners.
Portraying myself in a better light is one of my objectives for this project.


## Design Process

The overall design rationale for this project is a clean, simplistic and aesthetic website that is
pleasing to the eyes. My website is mainly targeted at working adults that are looking to hire. 
People of all ages are of course welcome be it to just take a look or to get inspiration from my
website. My portfolio has all the necessary information about me, jam packed into a compact and simple
single scroll website that is easy to navigate. I believe that employers seeking for young blood will
be able to consider hiring after looking at my website.

    User stories:

    As an employer, I want to hire young adults to unleash their potential in my job sector.
    As an employee, I want to show off my talent and potential to potential business partners and be able to get a job.
